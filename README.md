# Cholesterol-Level-Analyzer-GUI-using-Java-AWT

Based on the readings of total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol,HDL cholesterol and triglycerides of a patientâ€™s blood sample taken in mg/dL obtained from Cholesterol Test/
Lipid Profile, the task at hand is to interpret these readings and check whether the patient has an ideal level of cholesterol or not by making use of AWT(Abstract Window
Toolkit) API of Java.

In my blog post on Coding Joy, I have discussed about how this problem can be tackled, the constraints and the variables used in order to develop this GUI using Java AWT.
